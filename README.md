This is my AI project of the Building AI course 

# Knee pain workout planner

## Summary

The idea of this project is to help users schedule a workout that is safe for their knees and can help them recover from their injury building strength and stability. The app should be able to predict the safety of new exercises using a logistic regression model. Moreover, I would like it to have improve overtime using feedback from the user.

## Background

I played volleyball for many years and I work part-time as a yoga teacher. Knee pain was one of the most common problems among volleyball players and is a fairly common issue for many of my clients as well. Of course professional athletes can easily receive the necessary assistance to adapt their workout schedule when they're affected by knee pain, but for amateurs or people who just exercise to stay healthy seeking professional help can take time and an extra effort that they might not be willing to put in. So they either stop exercising all together or they end up doing it unsafely. This app can provide a solution for this and help them maintaining their workout routine while keeping their knees healthy.

## How does it work?

## Data Source and AI method

## Challenges

There is the danger that the app could be used as a replacement for consulting a medical professional. Clearly, this can become problematic when the injury requires a prompt medical treatment or when rest is absolutely necessary to recover fully.

## What next?

An idea to face the challenges I presented would be to team up with medical professionals to improve the app. A very useful development would be to add a "proposed diagnosis" as the user answers the initial questions.

## Acknowledgements

I want to thank chatGPT for helping me refining my idea for the project. I knew I wanted to write a project about a workout planner and I had a couple of ideas in mind (besides this one, a workout schedule for pro athletes to improve a specific aspect of their performance and a few similar ones). I asked chatGPT to help me select something that is reasonable to implement in terms of availability of data.
